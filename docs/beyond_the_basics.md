# Beyond the basics

Now that you have [created your first Teller Repository](create_repository) and learned how to [observe it](observe_repository), you can learn about some of the advanced functionality of Teller. 

Check out the documents below:

* [Clear Teller data](clear) - Use anytime you delete all of the data in your app. Such as when the user of your app logs out of their account. 
* [Refresh data in the background](refresh) - To keep your app's data always up-to-date to give your app's users the latest information, run a background job that refreshes your `OnlineRepository`s. 

## What's next? 

The next step is to, well, keep building your app. Go write some code! 

....but if you decide you would rather do more reading, I have a couple recommendations. 

Learn about another awesome library, [Wendy](https://github.com/levibostian/Wendy-Android), to help you build fast, offline-first mobile apps.
